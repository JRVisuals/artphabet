            "A dream – Working someplace to the north of here; \
            a channel like depression in the earth with a few woods; \
            a trolley line took us home at night, in my spare time I painted having brought my materials along; \
            one I sketched was the weird setting sun thru the doorway of a deserted house. \
            Towards evening when everyone seemed getting ready to go home, \
            I noticed in the hot yellow afterglow; bluebirds clinging to an old board fence; \
            they seemed asleep and I was able to pick them off and put them in my pocket. \
            Thunder was heard rumbling; in the gathering gloom I noticed a kite in the sky, \
            then more & more appeared. It seemed as if the boys flying them had lost control of them [as] the strings sagged low over the earth. \
            I was able to gather them all together in my hand. \
            The kites were falling, I gave the string a jerk and stepped back a few paces; \
            they spring up in the air again radiating from my hand; \
            I was considering whether to tie all the strings together for a joke when the six o’clock car whistled.  \
            It seemed as if my duty was to see that all left the place on time, and that I myself, \
            the last to leave had to catch the car in the rain.  \
            Then I remembered that I had left my sketching material on the ground somewhere.  \
            The sketches I had removed from the portfolio and laid in some swamp grass, \
            the portfolio in some bushes.  \
            On finding the latter it was submerged in water a few inches; \
            anxious, I sought the sketches only to find them entirely covered with water.  \
            I lifted them carefully out; \
            the one of the sunset had been soaked and the paint partly transfigured & the back of another.  \
            By this time of course the car was gone & I had the prospects of waiting an hour; \
            but now I saw that a young man from town had his car with him. \
            [Though] I had never asked him, still I asked him to take me home with him. \
            He consented but was waiting for his mother-in-law to come.  \
            The dream broke off here –",

            "Nature's first green is gold, \
            Her hardest hue to hold. \
            Her early leaf's a flower; \
            But only so an hour. \

            So dawn goes down to day. \

            "Make a nesting now, a place to which \
            the birds can come, think of Kevin's \
            prayerful palm holding the blackbird's egg \
            and be the one, looking out from this place \
            who warms interior forms into light. \
            Feel the way the cliff at your back \
            gives shelter to your outward view \
            and then bring in from those horizons \
            all discordant elements that seek a home. \
            \
            Be taught now, among the trees and rocks, \
            how the discarded is woven into shelter, \
            learn the way things hidden and unspoken \
            slowly proclaim their voice in the world. \
            Find that far inward symmetry \
            to all outward appearances, apprentice \
            yourself to yourself, begin to welcome back \
            all you sent away, be a new annunciation, \
            make yourself a door through which \
            to be hospitable, even to the stranger in you. \
            \
            See with every turning day, \
            how each season makes a child \
            of you again, wants you to become \
            a seeker after rainfall and birdsong, \
            watch now, how it weathers you \
            to a testing in the tried and true, \
            admonishes you with each falling leaf, \
            to be courageous, to be something \
            that has come through, to be the last thing \
            you want to see before you leave the world. \
            \
            Above all, be alone with it all, \
            a hiving off, a corner of silence \
            amidst the noise, refuse to talk, \
            even to yourself, and stay in this place \
            until the current of the story \
            is strong enough to float you out. \
            \
            Ghost then, to where others \
            in this place have come before, \
            under the hazel, by the ruined chapel, \
            below the cave where Coleman slept, \
            become the source that makes \
            the river flow, and then the sea \
            beyond. Live in this place \
            as you were meant to and then, \
            surprised by your abilities, \
            become the ancestor of it all, \
            the quiet, robust and blessed Saint \
            that your future happiness \
            will always remember."
